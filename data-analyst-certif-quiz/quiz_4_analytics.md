## Q4
Create table in Hive/Impala, with below definitions.
HadoopExamint(x int, property string);
Then accomplish following activities ;
1-Insert some values and mention their property whether odd or even number.
2-Calculate average values for each property.
3-Calculate the Cumulative Average for each property.
4-Calculate the Cumulative Average for each property, considering all preceding rows till current rows.
5-Calculate moving average by considering 3 rows (1 previous, 1 Current and 1 following)

## Solutions
### Q1
CREATE TABLE HadoopExamint ( x INT, property string) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' STORED AS TEXTFILE; 

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE HadoopExamInt values (1,'odd'),(2,'even'),(3,'odd'),(4.'even'),(5,'odd'),(6,'even'),(7,'odd'),(8,'even'),(9,'odd'),(10,'even');

SELECT * from HadoopExamint;

### Q2
select x, property, avg(x) over (partition by property) as avg from HadoopExamInt where property in ('odd','even');

?? possible solution but not in the spirit of this exercise
select property, avg(x) from HadoopExamint group by property;

### Q3
select x, property,
avg(x) over (partition by property order by x) as 'cumulative average' 
from HadoopExamInt;

or 
select x, property,
avg(x) over (partition by property order by x) as 'cumulative average' 
from HadoopExamInt where property in ('odd','even');

### Q4
select x, property,
avg(x) over
(
partition by property
order by x
range between unbounded preceding and current row 
) as 'cumulative average'
from HadoopExamint where property in ('odd','even');


Across all properties

select x, property,avg(x) over
order by x
range between unbounded preceding and current row ) as 'cumulative average'
from HadoopExannInt;

### Q5
select x, property, avg(x) over
(
partition by property
order by x
rows between 1 preceding and 1 following
) as 'moving average'
from HadoopExamInt where property in ('odd','even');
